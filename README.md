# System-Design-Java

This repository showcases a variety of low-level system design implementations using Java. All projects are developed as console-based applications with a focus on object-oriented principles, real-world modeling, and clean code practices.

## 📁 Projects Included

- 🎮 `BrickBreakGame` – A simple terminal-based brick breaker game using logic and loops.
- 📆 `CalenderSystem` – Console-based calendar system to display and manage dates/months.
- 💾 `DataBaseCommands` – Simulates basic database commands (CRUD operations) in-memory.
- 🧾 `InvoiceManagementSystem` – Generates and manages invoices in a structured format.
- 📚 `LibraryManagementSystem` – Allows book borrowing, returning, and inventory tracking.
- 🐍 `SnakeGame` – Classic snake game implemented with Java logic on the console.
- 🚖 `TaxiBookingSystem` – Book and manage taxis using object-oriented models.
- 🛣️ `TollPaymentSystem` – Simulates toll booth operations with vehicle and payment tracking.
